## What is Seedance 2.0?

Seedance 2.0 is the latest AI video generation model from ByteDance (the company behind TikTok and CapCut). It transforms text descriptions or reference images into high-quality 1080p videos with native audio synchronization — meaning lip-sync, dialogue, sound effects, and background music are generated alongside the video, not added as an afterthought.

### Key Highlights

- **Native 2K Resolution** — Output up to 2K quality for cinematic results
- **Multi-Shot Storytelling** — Automatically split a single prompt into multiple coherent shots
- **Audio-Video Sync** — Real-time lip-sync in 8+ languages including Chinese dialects
- **Universal Reference System** — Upload up to 12 reference files (images, videos, audio) to guide generation
- **@ Mention Control** — Precisely assign each uploaded asset's role with `@Image1`, `@Video1`, `@Audio1` syntax

## Getting Started: Your First Seedance 2.0 Video

### Step 1: Access the Platform

Seedance 2.0 is available on multiple platforms:

- **Dreamina (即梦)** — ByteDance's official creative platform at [dreamina.capcut.com](https://dreamina.capcut.com)
- **Third-party APIs** — Services like getimg.ai, fluxai.pro, and Atlas Cloud offer Seedance 2.0 API access

Sign up, log in, and select **Seedance 2.0** as your video generation model.

### Step 2: Choose Your Creation Mode

Seedance 2.0 supports three primary modes:

| Mode | Input | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Text-to-Video (T2V)** | Text prompt only | Creative concepts, quick prototyping |
| **Image-to-Video (I2V)** | Image(s) + text prompt | Product demos, character animation |
| **Multi-Shot Narrative** | Multiple references + text | Short films, ads, story sequences |

### Step 3: Write Your First Prompt

For a simple text-to-video generation, type a descriptive prompt in the input box. Here's an example:

```
A young woman in a red dress walks through a blooming cherry blossom garden.
Soft golden hour lighting. Camera slowly dollies forward, following her path.
Petals drift gently in the breeze.
```

Click **Generate** and wait approximately 40–60 seconds for your 5-second 1080p video.

## Prompt Writing: The Complete Formula

The quality of your Seedance 2.0 output depends heavily on your prompt. Follow this proven structure:

### The Seedance Prompt Formula

```
Prompt = Subject + Movement + Scene + Camera + Style
```

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Subject** | Who or what is in the scene | "A bearded chef in a white apron" |
| **Movement** | What actions are happening | "flips a pancake with a dramatic toss" |
| **Scene** | Environment and setting | "in a rustic farmhouse kitchen, morning light streaming through windows" |
| **Camera** | Camera angle and movement | "Medium shot, slow push-in" |
| **Style** | Visual mood and aesthetic | "Warm cinematic color grading, shallow depth of field" |

### Prompt Length Best Practices

- **Optimal range**: 30–100 words
- Too short → AI may misinterpret your intent
- Too long → Loses focus, reduces video quality
- Focus on the **key visual elements** that matter most

### Camera Movement Keywords

Seedance 2.0 understands natural-language camera descriptions:

| Camera Move | Prompt Keywords |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Orbit/Surround | "camera orbits around the subject", "360-degree rotation" |
| Aerial/Drone | "aerial shot looking down", "drone flyover" |
| Zoom | "slow zoom in on face", "dramatic zoom out" |
| Pan | "camera pans left to right", "horizontal pan" |
| Follow/Track | "camera follows the character", "tracking shot" |
| Handheld | "handheld camera style", "slight camera shake" |
| Static | "locked-off camera", "static wide shot" |

### Negative Prompts

Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements:

```
Negative: blurry, low quality, distorted faces, extra fingers, watermark
```

Keep negative prompts concise — overly complex exclusions can confuse the model.

## Image-to-Video: Bringing Still Images to Life

### Basic I2V Workflow

1. Switch to **Image-to-Video** mode
2. Upload your reference image
3. Add a text prompt describing the desired motion
4. Generate

### Example

Upload a product photo of headphones, then prompt:

```
The headphones rotate slowly on a reflective black surface.
Soft studio lighting with blue and purple accents.
Camera orbits 180 degrees. Sleek commercial aesthetic.
```

### Tips for Better I2V Results

- Use **high-resolution** source images (1080p+)
- Describe the **motion** you want — the AI already sees the visual from your image
- Specify camera movement explicitly for more cinematic results
- Works best with clear subjects and uncluttered backgrounds

## Multi-Shot Storytelling: Director-Level Control

This is Seedance 2.0's most powerful feature — generating multiple coherent video shots from a single prompt while maintaining character consistency, lighting, and narrative flow.

### How Multi-Shot Works

1. Select **Multi-Shot Mode** on the platform
2. Upload reference images for characters, scenes, and style
3. Write a narrative prompt describing your story
4. Seedance 2.0 automatically:
   - Splits your narrative into distinct shots
   - Maintains character identity across shots
   - Creates smooth transitions between scenes
   - Keeps lighting and atmosphere consistent

### Multi-Shot Prompt Example

```
Shot 1: A detective in a trench coat stands in a dimly lit alley,
looking at a photograph. Close-up on his face. Rain falling.

Shot 2: Wide shot of a neon-lit city street at night.
The detective walks toward a jazz club entrance. Camera follows from behind.

Shot 3: Inside the club. Warm amber lighting. The detective sits
at the bar and orders a drink. Medium shot. Saxophone music plays softly.
```

### Best Practices for Multi-Shot

- Keep each shot description focused on **one key action or moment**
- Use consistent character descriptions across shots
- Specify lighting transitions if the scene changes (e.g., outdoor → indoor)
- Upload character reference images to ensure identity consistency

## The Universal Reference System: @ Mention Control

Seedance 2.0's `@` mention system gives you granular control over how each uploaded asset influences the generation.

### Upload Limits

| File Type | Maximum |
|-----------|---------|
| Images | 9 files |
| Videos | 3 files |
| Audio | 3 files |
| **Total** | **12 files** |

### @ Syntax Guide

After uploading files, reference them in your prompt:

```
@Image1 as the main character reference.
@Image2 for the background environment.
@Video1 for camera movement style.
@Audio1 as background music.

A young woman (@Image1) walks through a futuristic city (@Image2)
with smooth tracking camera (@Video1). Ambient electronic soundtrack (@Audio1).
```

### What Each Reference Type Controls

| Reference Type | What It Provides |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Image** | Character appearance, scene composition, style, color palette |
| **Video** | Camera movement, action rhythm, pacing, motion style |
| **Audio** | Background music, dialogue sync, sound effects, emotional tone |

## Native Audio-Video Synchronization

One of Seedance 2.0's standout features is native audio generation — the AI creates audio and video simultaneously.

### Audio Capabilities

- **Lip-sync dialogue** in 8+ languages (including Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese dialects)
- **Environmental sound effects** — rain, traffic, footsteps, wind
- **Background music** matching the scene's mood
- **Precise mouth movement** aligned with speech rhythms

### How to Use Audio Features

**Option 1: Auto-generated audio**
Simply describe sounds in your prompt:

```
A man speaks into a microphone: "Welcome to the show, everyone!"
Crowd cheering in the background. Upbeat music plays.
```

**Option 2: Audio reference input**
Upload an audio file and reference it:

```
@Audio1 as the character's voice.
A woman speaks the dialogue from @Audio1 while sitting at a café table.
Natural ambient café sounds in the background.
```

## Advanced Techniques & Pro Tips

### 1. One-Click Video Recreation

Seedance 2.0 can recreate the style of popular videos. Upload a reference video and prompt:

```
Recreate the style and camera movement of @Video1,
but with a different character: a young man in a blue suit
walking through a modern art museum.
```

### 2. Video Extension

Generate a 5-second clip, then use the **extension** feature to continue the scene seamlessly, building longer narratives piece by piece.

### 3. Character Replacement

Use the editing tools to swap characters within an existing generated video while maintaining all other scene elements.

### 4. Combining Multiple Reference Types

For maximum control, combine all reference types:

```
@Image1 character face reference
@Image2 outfit and clothing style
@Image3 background environment
@Video1 camera movement pattern
@Audio1 background music

A woman (@Image1) wearing the outfit from @Image2
dances gracefully in the setting of @Image3.
Camera follows the movement pattern of @Video1.
Music: @Audio1.
```

### 5. Prompt Optimization Checklist

Before generating, verify your prompt includes:

- [ ] Clear subject description
- [ ] Specific actions/movements
- [ ] Scene/environment details
- [ ] Camera angle and movement
- [ ] Lighting and mood
- [ ] Style or aesthetic reference
- [ ] Audio elements (if needed)

## Seedance 2.0 vs Competitors

| Feature | Seedance 2.0 | Sora 2 | Kling 3.0 |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Best At** | Multi-shot narrative | Physics simulation | Motion fluidity |
| **Audio Sync** | Native (built-in) | Separate | Limited |

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Characters look different across shots
→ Upload a clear, front-facing character reference image and use `@Image1` consistently in all shot descriptions.

### Lip-sync doesn't match audio
→ Keep dialogue sentences short and clear. Avoid overlapping multiple speakers in one shot.

### Camera movement is jittery
→ Seedance 2.0 works best with controlled, single-direction camera moves. Avoid combining multiple camera movements in one shot.

### Video quality is blurry
→ Ensure you're generating at 1080p resolution (costs 5 credits vs 1 credit for 480p). Add "high quality, sharp details" to your prompt.

## Conclusion

Seedance 2.0 brings director-level AI video generation to everyone. Its combination of multi-shot storytelling, native audio sync, and universal reference system makes it uniquely powerful for creators who need narrative coherence and cinematic quality.
