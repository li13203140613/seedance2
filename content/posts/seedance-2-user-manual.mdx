# 🌀 Video Seedance 2.0 is now officially live on Seedance! Kill the game!
Remember when we could only "tell stories" with text and first/last frames? From that day on, we wanted to build a video model that truly understands your expression. Today, it's finally here!
Seedance 2.0 now supports four input modalities: image, video, audio, and text, offering richer expression and more controllable generation.
You can use an image to set the visual style, a video to specify character movements and camera changes, and a few seconds of audio to drive the rhythm and atmosphere... combined with prompts, the creative process becomes more natural, more efficient, and more like being a real "director."
In this upgrade, "reference capability" is the biggest highlight:
•
📷 Reference images can precisely reproduce composition and character details
•
🎥 Reference videos support replication of camera language, complex action rhythms, and creative effects
•
⏱ Videos support smooth extension and continuation, generating consecutive shots based on user prompts — not just generating, but also "continuing to shoot"
•
✂️ Editing capabilities are also enhanced, supporting character replacement, deletion, and addition in existing videos
We know that video creation has never been just about "generation" — it's about control over expression. 2.0 is not just multimodal; it's a truly controllable creative approach.
Seedance 2.0, multimodal creation, starts here. Dare to imagine boldly, and leave the rest to it.
## 1.

(Having reference videos costs a bit more)
Audio Input
Supports MP3 upload, quantity ≤ 3, total duration not exceeding 15s
Text Input
Natural language
Generation Duration
≤ 15s, freely selectable from 4-15s
Audio Output
Built-in sound effects/background music
Interaction limit: The current maximum for mixed input is 12 files. It's recommended to prioritize uploading materials that have the greatest impact on visuals or rhythm, and allocate the number of files across different modalities wisely.
## 2.
Interaction Format
⚠️ Note:
•
Seedance 2.0 supports the "First/Last Frame" and "All-in-One Reference" entry points. Smart Multi-Frame and Subject Reference cannot be selected. If you only upload a first frame image + prompt, you can use the First/Last Frame entry; if you need multimodal (image, video, audio, text) combined input, you need to enter through the All-in-One Reference entry.
•
The current supported interaction method is to specify the purpose of each image, video, and audio through "@material name," for example: @Image1 as the first frame, @Video1 for camera language reference, @Audio1 for background music.

Below are some usage examples and techniques for different scenarios to help you better understand the upgrades in Seedance 2.0's generation quality, control capabilities, and creative expression. If you don't know where to start, take a look at these examples first for inspiration~
# Seedance 2.0 Capabilities / Upgrade Preview
## 1.
Foundational Capabilities Significantly Enhanced: More Stable, Smoother, More Realistic!
Not just multimodal — Seedance 2.0 is significantly enhanced at the foundational level. Physics are more reasonable, motion is more natural and fluid, instruction understanding is more precise, and style consistency is more stable. It can reliably complete complex actions, continuous movements, and other challenging generation tasks, while also making overall video quality more realistic and smoother. This is a comprehensive evolution of core capabilities!

Ultra-strong realism
The character in the painting has a guilty expression, eyes darting left and right, peeking out of the picture frame. Quickly reaches a hand out of the frame to grab a cola and takes a sip, then shows a satisfied expression. At this moment, footsteps are heard. The character in the painting hurriedly puts the cola back in its original position. Then a western cowboy picks up the cup of cola and walks away. Finally, the camera pushes forward as the scene gradually fades to a pure black background with only a top light illuminating a canned cola. Artistic subtitles and narration appear at the bottom of the screen: "Yikou Cola — a must-try!"

The camera slowly zooms out (revealing the full street view) and follows the female lead as she moves. The wind blows her skirt hem as she walks down a 19th-century London street. As she walks, a steam-powered vehicle approaches from the right side of the street, speeding past her. The wind blows her skirt up, and she frantically uses both hands to press down her skirt hem in shock. Background sound effects include footsteps, crowd noise, car sounds, etc.

Multimodal Comprehensive Upgrade: Video Creation Enters the "Free Combination" Era!
### 2.1
Seedance 2.0 Multimodal Introduction
•
Supports uploading text, images, videos, and audio — all of which can be used as subjects or references. You can reference any content's actions, effects, style, camera movement, characters, scenes, and sounds. As long as the prompt is written clearly, the model can understand it.
•
Seedance 2.0 = Multimodal reference capability (can reference anything) + Strong creative generation + Precise instruction response (excellent comprehension)
•
Simply describe the visuals and actions you want in natural language. Specify whether it's a reference or an edit. When there are many materials, it's recommended to double-check that each @reference is clearly labeled — don't mix up images, videos, and characters!
### 2.2
Special Usage Methods (No limitations — for reference only):
•
Have a first/last frame image? Also want to reference video actions?
 → Write it clearly in the prompt, e.g.: "@Image1 as first frame, reference @Video1's fighting actions"
•
Want to extend an existing video?
 → Specify the extension duration, e.g., "Extend @Video1 by 5s." Note: The selected generation duration should be the duration of the "new portion" (e.g., extend by 5s, generation length should also be set to 5s)
•
Want to merge multiple videos?
 → Describe the composition logic in the prompt, e.g.: "I want to add a scene between @Video1 and @Video2, with the content being xxx"
•
No audio material? You can directly reference the sound from a video
•
Want to generate continuous actions?
 → Add continuity descriptions in the prompt, e.g.: "The character transitions directly from jumping to rolling, maintaining smooth and fluid motion" @Image1@Image2@Image3...
### 2.3
Those persistently difficult video problems can now truly be solved!
When making videos, you always run into headaches: faces changing, actions not matching, video extensions looking unnatural, edits that throw off the entire rhythm... This time, multimodal capabilities solve all these "stubborn problems" in one go. Here are the specific use cases below 👇
#### 2.3.1
Consistency Comprehensively Improved
You may have encountered these frustrations: characters looking different between shots, product details getting lost, small text becoming blurry, scenes jumping, camera styles that can't be unified... These common consistency issues in creation can now all be solved in 2.0. From faces to clothing to font details, overall consistency is more stable and precise.

The man @Image1 walks tiredly down the hallway after getting off work. His pace slows, and he finally stops at his front door. Close-up of his face — the man takes a deep breath, adjusts his emotions, puts away his negative feelings, and becomes relaxed. Then a close-up of him searching for his keys, inserting them into the lock. After entering the house, his little daughter and a pet dog joyfully run over to greet and hug him. The interior is very warm and cozy. Natural dialogue throughout.

 0-3 seconds: The male lead with the appearance of the character in reference Image 1 holds up a basketball, looks up at the camera, and says: "I just wanted to have a drink — am I really about to time-travel...?"
4-8 seconds: The camera suddenly shakes violently. The playground scene begins to shake intensely, instantly switching to an ancient courtyard on a rainy night. A beautiful woman in ancient costume, with piercing eyes cutting through the rain curtain, gazes toward the camera. Thunder rumbles, robes flutter in the wind. The female lead speaks: "Who dares trespass into my Yongning Marquis residence?" 9-13 seconds: The camera cuts to a man in Ming dynasty official robes sitting in a magistrate's hall, his gaze sharp as a blade. He speaks angrily: "Guards! Seize this 'demon' immediately!" Flashback: The male lead wearing ill-fitting rough linen clothes; desperately running from the guards; his silhouette crossing paths with the female lead in a rainy alley; the male lead wearing official robes walking through the imperial palace. 14-15 seconds: Black screen, the title "Dreams of Splendor" appears, accompanied by heavy drumbeats.

Reference all transitions and camera movements from @Video1. One continuous shot. The scene starts with a chess game. The camera pans left, showing yellow sand on the floor. The camera tilts up to a beach with footprints. A girl in white plain clothes walks further away on the beach. The camera switches to an overhead aerial perspective, with seawater washing the shore (no people). Seamless gradient transition — the washing waves transform into flowing curtains. The camera pulls back, showing a close-up of the girl's face. One continuous shot.

#### 2.3.3
Creative Templates / Precise Replication of Complex Effects
Not just generating images and writing stories — Seedance 2.0 also supports "learning by imitation." Creative transitions, finished ads, movie clips, complex edits — as long as you have reference images or videos, the model can identify action rhythms, camera language, and visual structure, and precisely replicate them. Don't worry if you don't know professional terminology — just clearly describe what you want to reference, such as "reference @Video1's rhythm and camera movement, @Image1's character style," and the model will generate a high-quality version of your own. Be bold! It really can do it.

Extend the 15s video. Reference the image of a donkey riding a motorcycle from @Image1 and @Image2. Add a whimsical advertisement segment.
Scene 1: Side fixed camera — the donkey rides the motorcycle bursting out of the pen. The nearby chickens are startled.
Scene 2: The donkey rides the motorcycle spinning on sandy ground. First a close-up of the motorcycle tire, then cut to an overhead aerial shot of the donkey doing spinning stunts on the motorcycle, kicking up smoke.
Scene 3: Snow mountain background shot — the donkey rides the motorcycle leaping off a hillside. The advertising slogan appears behind the subject through a mask effect (as the donkey and motorcycle fly past) — "Inspire Creativity, Enrich Life" appears in the middle. Finally as the motorcycle flies past, a cloud of dust kicks up.

The man uses his powerful upper body to pull up on the rings. Then "DO SOME SPORT" advertising ending text appears in the middle of the video.

Extend forward by 10s. In warm afternoon light, the camera starts from the row of awnings at the street corner being lifted by a gentle breeze, then slowly tilts down to small daisies poking out at the base of the wall. Next, the protagonist's red sneakers appear — he's squatting in front of a flower stand on the street, smiling as he gathers a big bunch of sunflowers into his arms, petals brushing against his white T-shirt. As he turns to step onto his skateboard, the flower stand owner shouts with a smile, "Watch out for the flying petals!" He waves at the owner, then starts skating. A few golden petals have already broken free from the bouquet, landing on the skateboard deck.

A roast session dialogue in the "Cat & Dog Roast Room," requiring rich emotions consistent with stand-up comedy performance:
Meow-chan (cat host, licking fur and rolling eyes): "Guys, who understands — this one next to me does nothing all day but wag his tail, tear up the sofa, and use that 'I'm so good please pet me' look to scam human snacks. He's fiercer than anyone when tearing up the house, yet still has the nerve to be called 'Wangzai' (Lucky Boy) — I think 'Wangchai' (Lucky Wrecker) fits better, hahaha!"
Wangzai (dog host, tilting head and wagging tail): "You have the nerve to call me out? You sleep 18 hours a day, and when you're awake, all you do is rub against human legs begging for canned food. You shed so much that every piece of black clothing is covered in your fur. After the humans finish sweeping, you turn around and roll on the sofa again. And you still pretend to be some aloof aristocrat?"

Chen Shimei's eyes dart back and forth frantically, searching for a way out, his expression extremely embarrassed. At this moment, from off-screen comes a Yu Opera female role's spoken line: "Wait!" Bao Zheng and Chen Shimei both look toward the right side of the frame.

Princess Iron Fan, because Red Boy was subdued by Wukong and made a disciple of Guanyin, separating mother and son, refuses to lend the fan and even seeks revenge. After Wukong's kind words fail, the two immediately get into an argument — narrate this short story.

One of them is a cloud decorated with colorful candy beans, always centered in frame. It then slowly morphs into the ice cream from @Image2. The camera pulls back into the cabin interior. The character from @Image3 sitting by the window reaches out to take the ice cream from outside the window, takes a bite, gets cream all over their mouth, and beams with a sweet smile.

Passersby continuously block the woman in red. At a corner, referencing @Image2's corner building, fixed camera — the woman in red leaves the frame, walks to the corner and disappears. A girl wearing a mask lurks at the corner, glaring menacingly. The masked girl's appearance references @Image3 — reference appearance only, the girl stands at the corner. The camera pans forward toward the female agent in red. She walks into a mansion and disappears. The mansion references @Image4. No camera cuts throughout — one continuous take.

High Usability for Video Editing
Sometimes you already have a video and don't want to start over finding images or redoing everything — you just want to adjust a small segment of action, extend a few seconds, or make a character's performance closer to your vision. Now you can directly use an existing video as input and make targeted modifications to specific segments, actions, or rhythm without changing other content. No need to regenerate from scratch — quick adjustments are now possible.

Subvert the plot of @Video1. The man's gaze shifts from tender to ice-cold and ruthless in an instant. In a moment when Rose is completely off guard, he shoves her off the bridge with force, pushing her into the water. The action is swift and decisive, carrying the resolve of a long-premeditated plan, without the slightest hesitation — completely overturning the original deeply affectionate character. The moment the female lead falls into the water, there's no scream — only an expression of utter disbelief. She looks up and screams at the man: "You've been deceiving me from the very beginning!" The man stands on the bridge, a cold smile on his face, and whispers to the water: "This is what you owe my family."

3-6 seconds: The woman behind him asks nervously, "How big?" The suited man looks up, lowering his voice: "Very big." Cut to hand close-up — he sets down the wine glass. Aura maxed out.
6-9 seconds: Suddenly the suited man pulls out from under the table — an absurdly oversized bag of snacks, and drops it on the table with a heavy "thud."
9-12 seconds: The woman behind him — her hand that was at her waist goes from tense to relaxed. Her entire expression softens. The atmosphere becomes lighthearted.

An 8-second intellectual battle-style anime combat clip, fitting a revenge theme. 0-3 seconds: In storyboard Image 1, the female lead turns and sits down. Camera transition. The female lead places a chess piece, and says "You've lost," referencing storyboard Image 2. 3-4 seconds: Quick camera pan, cutting to a close-up of the man's face across the way, referencing storyboard Image 3. The man grits his teeth, extremely dissatisfied with the result. 4-6 seconds: Camera cut, overhead shot. The woman places a chess piece. The people across gasp in amazement, referencing storyboard Image 4. 6-8 seconds: The camera rapidly tilts downward. The screen fades to black for a transition. Then the screen gradually brightens. In a dimly lit room, the woman looks at the moonlight outside the window and quietly says, "We'll see about that," referencing storyboard Image 5.
